* There might need to be a separate model for "Roles", like there are for "Post Categories"

* Maybe make update files for Roles and Admin privileges

* When assigning roles in the user model you use the role relationship name
e.g. User: [
        { 'name.first': 'Admin', 'name.last': 'User', email: 'admin@keystonejs.com', password: 'whatevs', isAdmin: true, roles: [ 'roleMember', 'roleAdmin' ] }
    ]

* We could possibly put all these update in one file, it would be cleaner.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* There is an exports.create function for adding users

* So.....for having people manually register, my thought process is:
1.) Signup view, with a form to put in Username and Password (maybe also 'retype password')
2.) Signup button
3.) Clicking said button calls the Create user function, with these params:
   a.) exports.create = {
 User: [
  //also passing in the type of user, since we have that working in the User model
  { 'name.first': 'val.firstn', 'name.last': 'val.lastn', email: 'userxx@smigglesmail.com', password: 'val.pass', isAdmin: false }
 ]
};
4.) Only users can access certain pages (done)
5.) Session auth (middleware is written, just hook it up)
6.) Only users can see/edit certain stuff without going into AdminUI (half done)
